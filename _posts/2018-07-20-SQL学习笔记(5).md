前言：此代码在Jupyter Notebook中运行，如在shell中运行去掉"%sql"

#### 一、准备工作

##### 1.1 加载sql模块

      $ %load_ext sql

##### 1.2 连接数据库

      $ %sql mysql://studentuser:studentpw@mysqlserver/dognitiondb

##### 1.3 设置dognitiondb为默认数据库

      $ %sql USE dognitiondb 
      
#### 二、高级查询方法

##### 2.1 分组总结函数 GROUP BY

$ %%sql
  SELECT test_name,AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
  FROM reviews
  GROUP BY test_name;

##### 2.2 HAVING语句

$ %%sql
  SELECT state, zip,COUNT(DISTINCT user_guid) AS Num_Guid
  FROM users
  WHERE country=‘US’
  GROUP BY state, zip
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT user_guid)>5
  ORDER BY state ASC,Num_Guid DESC;         ##HAVING后可以加聚合语句，用于分组条件，WHERE后不可以加聚合语句

####Every non-aggregated field that is listed in the SELECT list must be listed in the GROUP BY list

##### 2.3 用JOIN语句内连接两个表
$ %%sql
  SELECT d.dog_guid AS DogID, d.user_guid AS UserID, AVG(r.rating) AS AvgRating, COUNT(r.rating) AS NumRatings, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type
  FROM dogs d, reviews r
  WHERE d.dog_guid=r.dog_guid AND d.user_guid=r.user_guid
  GROUP BY UserID, DogID, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type
  HAVING NumRatings >= 10
  ORDER BY AvgRating DESC
  LIMIT 200;

  SELECT d.dog_guid AS DogID, d.user_guid AS UserID, AVG(r.rating) AS AvgRating, COUNT(r.rating) AS NumRatings, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type
  FROM dogs d JOIN reviews r ON d.dog_guid=r.dog_guid AND d.user_guid=r.user_guid    ##内连接的传统写法
  GROUP BY d.user_guid
  HAVING NumRatings > 9
  ORDER BY AvgRating DESC
  LIMIT 200;

  %%sql
  SELECT d.dog_guid AS DogID, d.user_guid AS UserID, AVG(r.rating) AS AvgRating, COUNT(r.rating) AS NumRatings, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type
  FROM dogs d, reviews r
  WHERE d.dog_guid=r.dog_guid AND d.user_guid=r.user_guid
  GROUP BY UserID, DogID, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type
  ORDER BY AvgRating DESC;

  %%sql
  SELECT d.user_guid AS UserID,d.dog_guid AS DogID,d.breed,d.breed_type,d.breed_group
  FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
  WHERE test_name='Yawn Warm-up'

  %%sql
  SELECT r.dog_guid AS rDogID, d.dog_guid AS dDogID, r.user_guid AS rUserID, d.user_guid AS dUserID, AVG(r.rating) AS AvgRating, COUNT(r.rating) AS NumRatings, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type
  FROM dogs d RIGHT JOIN reviews r ON d.dog_guid=r.dog_guid AND d.user_guid=r.user_guid
  WHERE r.dog_guid IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY r.dog_guid
  HAVING NumRatings >= 10
  ORDER BY AvgRating DESC;

  %%sql
  SELECT d.dog_guid AS dDogID,c.dog_guid AS cDogID,d.user_guid AS dUserID,c.user_guid AS cUerID,COUNT(test_name) AS NumTests
  FROM dogs d LEFT JOIN complete_tests c ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
  GROUP BY d.dog_guid;

  %%sql
  SELECT u.user_guid AS uUserID, d.user_guid AS dUserID, d.dog_guid AS dDogID,d.breed, COUNT(*) AS numrows 
  FROM users u LEFT JOIN dogs d ON u.user_guid=d.user_guid 
  GROUP BY u.user_guid 
  ORDER BY numrows DESC;

##### 2.5 子查询嵌套
$ %%sql
  SELECT * 
  FROM exam_answers
  WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)>(SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)) AS AvgDuration
  FROM exam_answers
  WHERE test_name='Yawn Warm-Up' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)>0);

  %%sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dog_guid)
  FROM dogs
  WHERE breed_group NOT IN ('Working','Sporting','Herding');

  SELECT DISTINCT u.user_guid AS uUserID
  FROM users u
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *FROM dogs d WHERE u.user_guid =d.user_guid);

  %%sql
  SELECT  u.user_guid
  FROM users u
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM dogs d WHERE u.user_guid=d.user_guid)  ##选出users中存在但dogs中不存在的所有user_guid

  %%sql
  SELECT DistinctUUsersID.user_guid AS uUserID, d.user_guid AS dUserID, count(*) AS numrows
  FROM (SELECT DISTINCT u.user_guid FROM users u) AS DistinctUUsersID   ##必须给derived table 起一个临时名字          
  LEFT JOIN dogs d ON DistinctUUsersID.user_guid=d.user_guid
  GROUP BY DistinctUUsersID.user_guid
  ORDER BY numrows DESC;

  %%sql
  SELECT d.user_guid
  FROM dogs d
  WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM users u WHERE u.user_guid=d.user_guid);

##### 2.6 IF语句
$ %%sql
  SELECT cleaned_users.user_guid AS UserID,IF(cleaned_users.first_account<'2014-06-01','early_user','late_user') AS user_type
  FROM (SELECT user_guid, MIN(created_at) AS first_account FROM users GROUP BY user_guid) AS cleaned_users

  %%sql
  SELECT IF(a.country='US','In US','Out of US') AS UserLocation,COUNT(a.user_guid) AS numguids
  FROM (SELECT distinct user_guid,country FROM users WHERE user_guid IS NOT NULL and country IS NOT NULL) AS a
 GROUP BY UserLocation;

##### 2.7 IF语句的嵌套
$ %%sql
  SELECT IF(cleaned_users.country='US','In US', IF(cleaned_users.country='N/A','Not Applicable','Outside US')) AS US_user, COUNT(cleaned_users.user_guid)   
  FROM (SELECT DISTINCT user_guid, country FROM users WHERE country IS NOT NULL) AS cleaned_users
  GROUP BY US_user;

##### 2.8 CASE语句
There are a couple of things to know about CASE expressions:
* Make sure to include the word END at the end of the expression
* CASE expressions do not require parentheses
* ELSE expressions are optional
* If an ELSE expression is omitted, NULL values will be outputted for all rows that do not meet any of the conditions stated explicitly in the expression
* CASE expressions can be used anywhere in a SQL statement, including in GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses or the SELECT column list.
 $ %%sql
   SELECT CASE WHEN cleaned_users.country="US" THEN "In US"
                         WHEN cleaned_users.country="N/A" THEN "Not Applicable"
                         ELSE "Outside US"
                         END AS US_user, 
      count(cleaned_users.user_guid)   
   FROM (SELECT DISTINCT user_guid, country 
      FROM users
      WHERE country IS NOT NULL) AS cleaned_users
   GROUP BY US_user

上例等价于
%%sql
SELECT CASE cleaned_users.country
            WHEN "US" THEN "In US"
            WHEN "N/A" THEN "Not Applicable"
            ELSE "Outside US"
            END AS US_user, 
      count(cleaned_users.user_guid)   
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT user_guid, country 
      FROM users
      WHERE country IS NOT NULL) AS cleaned_users
GROUP BY US_user

%%sql
SELECT dog_guid,dog_fixed,
    CASE dog_fixed
      WHEN '1' THEN 'neutered'
        WHEN '0' THEN 'not neutered'
    END AS neutered
FROM dogs LIMIT 200

逻辑语句的执行顺序 1.NOT 2.AND 3.OR
